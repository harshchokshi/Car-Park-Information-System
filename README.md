# Car-Park-Information-System
Tracks the details of cars parked in parking facility.
The program will provide the means to track the details of cars currently within the parking structure. Customers of the car park first register their details. When a car enters the facility the attendant records that the car has checked in when the car leaves the attendant can record that the car has checked out. At any time the attendant can produce a list of cars currently within the parking structure (along with their details) to aid in audits and security checks.
